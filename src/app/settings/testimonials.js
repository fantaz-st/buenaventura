    text: "We have absolutely no regrets! The boat is superb, big and very comfortable! All the stops were amazing, and we were able to dive to observe the fish with masks and snorkels. Everything is well organised, we can do a bit of island-hopping, but if we want to, we can also take advantage of the boat. We even got to see some dolphins! Cedo and Bruno were really the best, very kind and friendly! The atmosphere was so good thanks to the playlist which was very good vibes! I really had an unforgettable day with my friends, I recommend it 10000% with my eyes closed!!",

    text: "This boat trip was just incredible. All we saw was amazing, every stop. Cedo and Bruno where extremely kind and friendly with us. They even rescued a sanked connected watch . The watch fell and sank near the boat and they found it after few minutes of research and dived to take it and give it back to the owner ! Seriously professional guys ! Cedo's boat is one of the best of Split boat tours if it's not THE best! Thanks for this unforgettable day. I recommend strongly this trip! Even the music was so good! Thank you !!
